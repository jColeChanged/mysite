Motivation

I had played a similar game with a friend and found it to be a lot of fun so when I wanted to write a program just for kicks and couldn't think of anything better to do, I latched onto this. As it turns out I found better things to work on  so right now this project isn't really that important to me. However, if you play it make sure to let me know. I don't want to leave focus bugs and cross browser inconsitency in something people are actually going to use.

Technical
